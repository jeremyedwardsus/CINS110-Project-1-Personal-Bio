    <h2>My computing biography has been a simple one</h2>
  <p>In my senior year of highschool i took a very basic computer programming class. It was my schools first year offering the class and as such,
    was somewhat poorly handled, despite my teachers vested interest in our work. Due to this, we barely made it past our third project,
    despite having 8 planned throughout the year. Until then, I had no prior knowledge of computer programming. Since then, my CINS110 class is the farthest
    Ive gone into any kind of programming.
