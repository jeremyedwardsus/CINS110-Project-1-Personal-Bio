    <h2>A simple upbringing</h2>
     <p>My development portfolio is fairly short, having only truly done the projects in this class. My work in highschool was done mostly in training programs used to teach syntax
       and stylistic elements of Java and C++. Since entering this class we have completed some 10 odd projects in lab and in class. My work has been entirely in HTML and CSS.</p>
